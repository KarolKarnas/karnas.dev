  - title: "Tutorial hell medicine"
    content: "The Odin Project is effective medicine for the tutorial hell problem. I have been there many times, watching another YT video, thinking that I can replicate the process easily. The Odin Project is not about procrastinating by watching videos or reading extensively about web development; it's about actively engaging in the process. The course encourages practical learning using essential tools like IDE (Visual Studio Code), Linux, Terminal, Git, and Github. Throughout the program, you'll delve into extensive documentation, draw your own conclusions, and apply your knowledge by building simple projects."

  - title: "The internal system"
    content: "The entire process is documented in the internal system of the Odin Project. It gives you sense of progress and motivate to progress. The scope of the course is divided in chapters. After some of them you have to make real projects in pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript. For me was very important to learn about the basics before jump start into React, Next.js or Object Oriented Programming"

  - title: "The sources"
    content: "In almost every lesson, we are provided with knowledge and instructions from the course authors. Additionally, we are introduced to valuable knowledge sources. These sources often lead us to places where the concepts were born and developed. Following these sources gives us an idea of the complex and lengthy journey that has led to the way web apps are written today. This is not just a simple concept; it is a long story of constant improvement of imperfect languages, tools, and methods."
    second_content: "Someone who believes that this is a fully organized world with a strict way of doing things should quickly reassess their position. This is a very complex world where one idea gives rise to another, and this cycle continues. It is not inherently negative, it is an evolutionary process. However, gaining a holistic understanding of this complexity is very challenging"

  - title: "The environment"
    content: "I highly value knowledge on how to learn. The Odin Project emphasizes avoiding distractions, such as social media. The Linux environment can help mitigate this issue if we treat it as a dedicated space for learning, without logging into our social media accounts here. Noise distractions can be minimized by using headphones with ANC - an excellent solution. Pomodoro technique is also recommended – learning in sequences of 25 minutes of study followed by 5 minutes of break – significantly enhances efficiency. The Linux Ubuntu has a good Pomodoro app"
