  - title: "The Process"
    content: "This time, I experimented with applying the Kanban methodology to my personal workflow. I utilized Jira for planning and tracked my progress using a Kanban Board. Additionally, I designed crucial elements in Figma. Subsequently, I initiated the development process, meticulously monitoring my progress, creating and managing tasks, and categorizing them as 'TO DO', 'IN PROGRESS' or 'DONE'. The application has been successfully published as an MVP. Currently, I am conducting thorough testing using Playwright, reviewing and addressing any errors, and continuously refining the design for optimal performance."
