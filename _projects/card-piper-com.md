  - title: "The Process"
    content: "This time, I experimented with applying the Kanban methodology to my personal workflow. I utilized Jira for planning and tracked my progress using a Kanban Board. Additionally, I designed crucial elements in Figma. Subsequently, I initiated the development process, meticulously monitoring my progress, creating and managing tasks, and categorizing them as 'TO DO', 'IN PROGRESS' or 'DONE'. The application has been successfully published as an MVP. Currently, I am conducting thorough testing using Playwright, reviewing and addressing any errors, and continuously refining the design for optimal performance."

App integrates user psychology profiling with cultural preferences in art,
literature, and more. The platform analyzes user interactions with popular
books, characters, quotes, and authors to create a dynamic, personalized
feed. I am currently enhancing the UX and expanding the database with
new entities. Utilized various data scraping techniques to gather and
curate content.
